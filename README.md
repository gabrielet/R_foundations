# R foundations for total beginners

The goal of these lessons is to develop a foundation of R, to develop a programming-oriented way of thinking and transform your ideas into code, to help you better understand other people's code, and to improve your coding skills.

This is what we will (try to) cover:

 - (ultra-short intro to R and RStudio);
 - variables and data structures;
 - matrices and dataframes;
 - functions;
 - statements and loops (if-else, for, while);
 - base plotting and ggplot2 plotting.
