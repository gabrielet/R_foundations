# R foundations for total beginners

The goal of these lessons is to develop a foundation of R. Also, we will try to develop programming-oriented way of thinking to transform your ideas into code, help you better understand other people's code, and improve your coding skills.

This is what we will (try to) cover:

 - (ultra-short intro to R and RStudio);
 - variables and data structures;
 - matrices and dataframes;
 - functions;
 - statements and loops (if-else, for, while);
 - base plotting and ggplot2 plotting.
